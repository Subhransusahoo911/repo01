# Introduction to Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration.

## Why Use Ansible?

- **Simple** to set up and use
- **Agentless** architecture (no need for additional software on clients)
- **Efficient** and reliable for automating repetitive tasks
- **Scales** well across environments, making it suitable for managing large infrastructures

## Example Use Case

For example, many companies in India, especially startups in Bengaluru's tech hub, use Ansible to automate the configuration of servers, enabling faster deployment cycles. Instead of manually configuring each server, a business can use Ansible to apply changes to hundreds of servers simultaneously, improving efficiency and reducing human error.
